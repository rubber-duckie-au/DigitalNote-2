/**
 * Thread-safe class to keep track of locked (ie, non-swappable) memory pages.
 *
 * Memory locks do not stack, that is, pages which have been locked several times by calls to mlock()
 * will be unlocked by a single call to munlock(). This can result in keying material ending up in swap when
 * those functions are used naively. This class simulates stacking memory locks by keeping a counter per page.
 *
 * @note By using a map from each page base address to lock count, this class is optimized for
 * small objects that span up to a few pages, mostly smaller than a page. To support large allocations,
 * something like an interval tree would be the preferred data structure.
