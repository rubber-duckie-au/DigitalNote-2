#ifndef _BITCOIN_ADDRMAN

// Stochastic address manager
//
// Design goals:
//  * Only keep a limited number of addresses around, so that addr.dat and memory requirements do not grow without bound.
//  * Keep the address tables in-memory, and asynchronously dump the entire to able in addr.dat.
//  * Make sure no (localized) attacker can fill the entire table with his nodes/addresses.
//
// To that end:
//  * Addresses are organized into buckets.
//    * Address that have not yet been tried go into 256 "new" buckets.
//      * Based on the address range (/16 for IPv4) of source of the information, 32 buckets are selected at random
//      * The actual bucket is chosen from one of these, based on the range the address itself is located.
//      * One single address can occur in up to 4 different buckets, to increase selection chances for addresses that
//        are seen frequently. The chance for increasing this multiplicity decreases exponentially.
//      * When adding a new address to a full bucket, a randomly chosen entry (with a bias favoring less recently seen
//        ones) is removed from it first.
//    * Addresses of nodes that are known to be accessible go into 64 "tried" buckets.
//      * Each address range selects at random 4 of these buckets.
//      * The actual bucket is chosen from one of these, based on the full address.
//      * When adding a new good address to a full bucket, a randomly chosen entry (with a bias favoring less recently
//        tried ones) is evicted from it, back to the "new" buckets.
//    * Bucket selection is based on cryptographic hashing, using a randomly-generated 256-bit key, which should not
//      be observable by adversaries.
//    * Several indexes are kept for high performance. Defining DEBUG_ADDRMAN will introduce frequent (and expensive)
//      consistency checks for the entire data structure.
